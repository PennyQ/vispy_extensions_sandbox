## This repo is a collection of experiments based on [Vispy](https://vispy.org/) for multi-dimensional data visualization and selection. 

## What are included:

- uniform_multi_iso: render an isosurface visual with multiple layers. The program takes one parameter `step` to decide the number of layers.

- 3dselection_vispy: 3D selection on scatter data and isosurface. 

- advanced_isosurface_vispy: visualization of a combination of scatter points and isosurface in one plot. 

- vispy_examples: multiple executable Vispy examples for 3d visualization.
